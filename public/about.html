<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Praveen JS, and I have a Bachelor's degree in Engineering (BE) with a focus on Automobile Engineering, which I completed in 2019. I spent the first few years of my career working in the core automobile industry, gaining hands-on experience and building a solid foundation in my field. However, during this time, I discovered that my true passion lies in the IT industry.<br>

  With a keen interest in technology and problem-solving, I decided to shift my career focus to web development. Currently, I am learning web development to enhance my skills and transition into the world of IT.<br>
  
  At present, I work as a System Engineer at IIT Madras College, where I get to combine my technical background with my growing expertise in IT. Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities ahead, and I am constantly learning and evolving in this dynamic field.</p>
